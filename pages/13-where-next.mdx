## A Final Render

First let's make the image on the cover of this book -- lots of random spheres:

```cpp filename="main.cc | Final scene"
    hittable_list random_scene() {
        hittable_list world;

        auto ground_material = make_shared<lambertian>(color(0.5, 0.5, 0.5));
        world.add(make_shared<sphere>(point3(0,-1000,0), 1000, ground_material));

        for (int a = -11; a < 11; a++) {
            for (int b = -11; b < 11; b++) {
                auto choose_mat = random_double();
                point3 center(a + 0.9*random_double(), 0.2, b + 0.9*random_double());

                if ((center - point3(4, 0.2, 0)).length() > 0.9) {
                    shared_ptr<material> sphere_material;

                    if (choose_mat < 0.8) {
                        // diffuse
                        auto albedo = color::random() * color::random();
                        sphere_material = make_shared<lambertian>(albedo);
                        world.add(make_shared<sphere>(center, 0.2, sphere_material));
                    } else if (choose_mat < 0.95) {
                        // metal
                        auto albedo = color::random(0.5, 1);
                        auto fuzz = random_double(0, 0.5);
                        sphere_material = make_shared<metal>(albedo, fuzz);
                        world.add(make_shared<sphere>(center, 0.2, sphere_material));
                    } else {
                        // glass
                        sphere_material = make_shared<dielectric>(1.5);
                        world.add(make_shared<sphere>(center, 0.2, sphere_material));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        auto material1 = make_shared<dielectric>(1.5);
        world.add(make_shared<sphere>(point3(0, 1, 0), 1.0, material1));

        auto material2 = make_shared<lambertian>(color(0.4, 0.2, 0.1));
        world.add(make_shared<sphere>(point3(-4, 1, 0), 1.0, material2));

        auto material3 = make_shared<metal>(color(0.7, 0.6, 0.5), 0.0);
        world.add(make_shared<sphere>(point3(4, 1, 0), 1.0, material3));

        return world;
    }

    int main() {

        // Image

        const auto aspect_ratio = 3.0 / 2.0;
        const int image_width = 1200;
        const int image_height = static_cast<int>(image_width / aspect_ratio);

        const int samples_per_pixel = 500;
        const int max_depth = 50;

        // World

        auto world = random_scene();

        // Camera

        point3 lookfrom(13,2,3);
        point3 lookat(0,0,0);
        vec3 vup(0,1,0);

        auto dist_to_focus = 10.0;
        auto aperture = 0.1;

        camera cam(lookfrom, lookat, vup, 20, aspect_ratio, aperture, dist_to_focus);

        // Render

        std::cout << "P3\n" << image_width << ' ' << image_height << "\n255\n";

        for (int j = image_height-1; j >= 0; --j) {
            ...
    }
```

This gives:

![Image 21: Final scene](../images/img-1.21-book1-final.jpg)

An interesting thing you might note is the glass balls don't really have shadows which makes them
look like they are floating. This is not a bug -- you don't see glass balls much in real life, where
they also look a bit strange, and indeed seem to float on cloudy days. A point on the big sphere
under a glass ball still has lots of light hitting it because the sky is re-ordered rather than
blocked.

## Next Steps

You now have a cool ray tracer! What next?

1.  Lights -- You can do this explicitly, by sending shadow rays to lights, or it can be done
    implicitly by making some objects emit light, biasing scattered rays toward them, and then
    downweighting those rays to cancel out the bias. Both work. I am in the minority in favoring
    the latter approach.

2.  Triangles -- Most cool models are in triangle form. The model I/O is the worst and almost
    everybody tries to get somebody else's code to do this.

3.  Surface Textures -- This lets you paste images on like wall paper. Pretty easy and a good thing
    to do.

4.  Solid textures -- Ken Perlin has his code online. Andrew Kensler has some very cool info at his
    blog.

5.  Volumes and Media -- Cool stuff and will challenge your software architecture. I favor making
    volumes have the hittable interface and probabilistically have intersections based on density.
    Your rendering code doesn't even have to know it has volumes with that method.

6.  Parallelism -- Run $N$ copies of your code on $N$ cores with different random seeds. Average
    the $N$ runs. This averaging can also be done hierarchically where $N/2$ pairs can be averaged
    to get $N/4$ images, and pairs of those can be averaged. That method of parallelism should
    extend well into the thousands of cores with very little coding.

Have fun, and please send me your cool images!
